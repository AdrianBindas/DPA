    """Main function implementing the Pointwise Adaptive k-NN density estimator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distances: array [n_samples, k_max+1]
        Distances to the k_max neighbors of each points. The point is included. 
  
    indices : array [n_samples, k_max+1]
        Indices of the k_max neighbors of each points. The point is included.

    k_max : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of nearest-neighbors considered by the procedure that returns the
        largest number of neighbors ``\hat{k}`` for which the condition of constant density 
        holds, within a given level of confidence. If the number of points in the sample N is 
        less than the default value, k_max will be set automatically to the value ``N/2``.
    
    D_thr : float, default=23.92812698
        Set the level of confidence. The default value corresponds to a p-value of 
        ``10**{-6}`` for a ``\chiË†2`` distribution with one degree of freedom.

    dim : int
        Intrinsic dimensionality of the sample.

    Results
    -------
    densities : array [n_samples]
        The logarithm of the density at each point.
    
    err_densities : array [n_samples]
        The uncertainty in the density estimation, obtained by computing 
        the inverse of the Fisher information matrix.

    k_hat : array [n_samples]
        The optimal number of neighbors for which the condition of constant density holds.

    dc : array [n_sample]
        The radius of the optimal neighborhood for each point.
